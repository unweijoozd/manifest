| Kubernetes Create Pod              | Create a Kubernetes pod with container ports 8080                                                         | Creates base pod with container ports 8080                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [`yaml/app.yaml`](yaml/app.yaml)                |
| Kubernetes Create Cron Job         | Create cron job that restart policy OnFailure and run every 5 minutes                                     | Creates cron job that restarts every 5 minutes and restart policy is OnFailure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [`yaml/app-cronjob.yaml`](yaml/app-cronjob.yaml)    |
| Kubernetes Create Job              | Configure a Kubernetes Job for synchronizing data from Google Cloud Storage to a GCE persistent disk.     | The Kubernetes Job 'app-job-rsync' syncs data from a Google Cloud Storage bucket to a GCE persistent disk using a container that runs Google Cloud SDK's gsutil command. It's configured with a 'Never' restart policy and no backoff limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [`yaml/app-job.yaml`](yaml/app-job.yaml)            |
| Kubernetes Create Liveliness Probe | Define a Kubernetes Pod with a Liveliness probe to monitor container health.                              | The Pod 'app-livenessprob' in the 'demo' namespace runs a container from the image gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v1.0.0. It includes a liveness probe that checks HTTP GET requests on the root path (/) at port 8000 every 10 seconds, starting after an initial 5 seconds delay. The probe times out after 1 second and allows up to 3 failures before taking corrective action. The container also exposes port 8080 for HTTP traffic.                          | [`yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml`](yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml)  |
| Kubernetes Create Multi Container  | Create a Kubernetes Pod with multiple containers sharing data via a shared volume.                        | The Pod 'app-multi-containers' includes two containers: the first container runs Nginx and serves content from a shared volume mounted at /usr/share/nginx/html, while the second container runs Debian and continuously writes the current date to a file in the shared volume at /html/index.html every second. The shared volume 'html' is an empty directory that persists data between the containers, allowing real-time data sharing and updates. | [`yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml`](yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| Setup Readiness Probe              | Set up a Kubernetes Pod with both liveness and readiness probes to ensure container health and readiness. | The Pod 'app-readinessprob' uses an image gcr.io/k8s-k3s/demo:v2.0.0 with liveness and readiness probes to manage container health. Liveness probes ensure ongoing operations by checking the root path every 10 seconds, while readiness probes assess traffic readiness every 2 seconds on /ready. Both probes use port 8000, with tight failure thresholds to maintain service reliability.                                                           | [`yaml/app-readinessProb.yaml`](yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml)  |
| Configure Kubernetes Pod           | Configure a Kubernetes Pod with resource limits and detailed health checks.                               | The Pod 'app-resource' runs a kuard-amd64:1 image with defined CPU and memory resources, and features liveness and readiness probes on port 8080 for continuous health and readiness checks. This setup ensures efficient operation and reliable service availability.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [`yaml/app-resources.yaml`](yaml/app-resources.yaml)      |
| Deploy Kubernetes Pod              | Deploy a Kubernetes Pod that utilizes secrets for sensitive environment variables.                        | The Pod 'app-secret-env' uses the redis image within a container named 'mycontainer'. It securely injects environment variables for username and password from a secret named 'mysecret1'. The Pod operates with a 'Never' restart policy, optimizing for scenarios where sensitive credentials are managed securely and the container does not automatically restart on failure.                                                                        | [`yaml/app-secret-env.yaml`](yaml/app-secret-env.yaml)     |
| Configure Pod with Volume Mounts   | Configure a Kubernetes Pod with a mounted volume for persistent data storage alongside health monitoring. | The Pod 'app-volume' utilizes the kuard-amd64:1 image and is equipped with a hostPath volume mounted at /data for persistent storage. Health is monitored using liveness and readiness probes on port 8080, checking /healthy and /ready paths respectively. This setup ensures that the container maintains stateful data and is consistently available and healthy for handling requests.                                                              | [`yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml`](yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml)   |
